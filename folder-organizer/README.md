## To upload

Here is a script for organize folders in published and unpublished by year. I made this while working as CM for a high school.

## Prerequisites

- To start, you need specific folder structure:

First folder `PUB_FOLDER` which been base folder for our structure follows to year folder follow for two folder "published" and "unpublished". Those two folder can have custom name.
